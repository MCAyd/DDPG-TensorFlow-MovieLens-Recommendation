# DDPG-TensorFlow-MovieLens-Recommendation
This project utilizes the MovieLens to implement a movie recommendation system. Employing DDPG algorithms adapted for discrete action spaces, the system minimizes incorrect recommendations through a punishment mechanism. The agent, governed by actor and critic, explores movie-user pairs, employing an epsilon-greedy for action selection.
